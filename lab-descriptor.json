  "introduction": "Sensor and Instrumentation laboratory is developed to understand the working of sensors required for measurements of different industrial parameters. The target audience for the laboratory is first-year, second-year and third-year undergraduate students of engineering. The sensors like load cell, cantilever beam, piezoelectric, hall, proximity, speed, sound, smoke, thickness, ultrasonic, and capacitance are described. A total of ten experiments are designed to understand sensors working and their applications. To use this laboratory effectively the users, need to study the fundamentals like the working of the sensor, and the operation of the sensor in the field. At the end of the experiment, a dashboard is displayed to inform the user about his/her areas for improvement",
